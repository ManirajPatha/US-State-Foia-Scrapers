    "bid_description": "The Vermont Geological Survey (VGS) has been engaged in assessing and inventorying landslide hazards in the state for many years; however, the magnitude of our vulnerability was not made fully clear until the July 2023 storm. After dozens of landslides were initiated by heavy precipitation and soil saturation, the VGS and its partners received requests to visit over 80 locations to assess hazards associated with slope instability. One year later, after another intense storm, the VGS responded to nearly 150 such requests. The VGS has received multiple inquiries into Vermont’s susceptibility to future high-magnitude landslide-triggering events, and specifically for maps of susceptibility. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will begin requiring such information in future State Hazard Mitigation Plan (SHMP) drafts.

    "bid_description": "The Vermont Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program is part of Vermont's overall strategy to control air pollution from motor vehicles. The Vermont LEV Program is also part of broader regional efforts to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles. Several other northeast states have implemented LEV programs. Combined, these LEV programs bring a significant number of vehicles that emit less air pollution to the northeast. All Vermonters benefit from improved air quality and Vermont motorists realize significant consumer benefits such as longer vehicle useful life requirements, stronger recall provisions, and greater warranty coverage. Inspection and maintenance (IM) of vehicle air pollution control systems is an important and cost-effective air pollution abatement strategy. Inspection requirements for these systems have been successfully integrated into the Vermont Vehicle Inspection Program. Since January 1, 2001, vehicles failing emissions inspections must be repaired prior to receiving a valid inspection sticker. While the Vehicle Inspection Program can identify vehicles with malfunctioning air pollution control systems, it is only through accurate diagnosis and proper repairs that the excess air pollution from these vehicles will be cost effectively reduced. Providing information and training to Vermont automotive technicians on accurately diagnosing and effectively repairing motor vehicles that have failed the inspection is essential to this effort. DEC is seeking proposals for a grant to conduct evaluation of, and outreach for Vermont’s LEV Program, and to develop, offer and deliver training classes to automotive repair technicians throughout the State. Up to $275,250.00 is available for the initial award, though it is anticipated more may become available for this project during the period of performance to be added via an agreement amendment or renewal process contingent on satisfactory performance.",

    "bid_description": "The Vermont Geological Survey (VGS), a Division within the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has been involved with landslide assessment and mapping for many years. Along with our partners, the State of Vermont (hereinafter the “State”) has performed landslide inventories for five of 14 counties in Vermont and created a “Report a Landslide” web tool that allows citizens to report landslide observations. The State’s landslide database has grown to include over 3000 documented landslides and unstable gullies. Even as the State’s inventory grew, the magnitude of vulnerability was not made fully clear until the aftermath of the July 2023 storm, when dozens of landslides were initiated by heavy precipitation and soil saturation. The State and our partners received requests to visit over 80 locations to assess hazards associated with slope instability. Since the July 2023 storm, the State has received multiple inquiries into Vermont’s susceptibility to future high-magnitude landslide-triggering events, and specifically for maps of susceptibility. The State is beginning to fill the need for these maps for the eastern portion of Vermont: this Request for Proposals is to provide susceptibility mapping coverage for the Vermont Piedmont and Northeast Highlands provinces (the Area of Interest, or “AOI”). This project aims to establish a multivariate analysis method in a geographical information system (GIS) that is capable of identifying landslide-prone areas. Topographic datasets including slope steepness and stream. Proximity will be derived from the best available Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topographic data and used along with other terrain elements including bedrock outcrops, landcover, soil erodibility, and hydrologic groups. Each of these parameters will be incorporated into a multivariate analysis using a weighted overlay function in ArcMap GIS to create composite risk assessment maps.

This project consists of, but is not limited to: The contractor shall demolish two (2) buildings in Barre City located on Vermont Route 14 (South Main Street) including the dwelling at 50 South Main Street and the detached garage. All components of the buildings shall be removed or decommissioned including foundations and utilities. The contractor shall remove both structures from the property including the foundations (with the exception of the poured concrete section of the garage foundation); driveway pavement; and all service lines (e.g., electrical, cable, telephone, water) to the residence up to the curb stop. The contractor shall grade and level with clean material to promote positive drainage away from the existing railroad track structure. The contractor shall complete the intended work in a manner that does not negatively impact the adjacent parcel or dwelling. The contractor will be held responsible for all damages to the adjacent parcel or dwelling if any occur while executing the intended work at 50 South Main Street. All damages shall be repaired or replaced by the contractor without cost to the State of Vermont and to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The contractor shall note that concrete block wall comprised of large solid concrete blocks is located behind the dwelling. It is considered independent of the structure and any removal of the dwelling and garage should have no effect on the slope behind them. However, the contractor shall note no excavation in front of the concrete block wall is allowed that could destabilize the wall as well as the global stability of the larger slope behind the dwelling and garage. The contractor shall completely remove the garage structure and its walls other than the poured concrete section. The contractor shall remove and reset the existing large concrete blocks that are adjacent to the railroad tracks in a stepped U-shape manner at the approximate foundation location of the garage to retain the soil in this area. Any remaining concrete blocks shall be used as fill within the existing garage footprint as well as additional clean, suitable material provided by the contractor. Hazardous material investigations have been completed and the findings included in the contract documents.

This project is located in Hyde Park along Centerville Brook, on a 0.25-acre parcel near the intersection of Centerville Road and Brook Road. Summer of 2023 the Town of Hyde Park applied for funding through the Lamoille Basin Clean Water Service Provider to pursue preliminary design engineering for this site. In fall of 2023 the Town of Hyde Park transferred project sponsorship and the awarded grant to the LCPC to manage and provide project coordination support.

    "bid_title": "Request of Proposals - Final Design Engineering Holmes Meadow Floodplain Restoration Johnson",
    "department": "Lamoille County Planning Commission",
    "bid_description": "In Partnership with the Lamoille County Planning Commission (LCPC), the Town of Johnson received a Flood Resilient Communities Fund Grant in Spring of 2021 funded by the Vermont Emergency Management to acquire a parcel in Johnson, and design, engineer, and construct an active floodplain restoration project on site. The final design will be informed by the local community vision and goals for the site. This proposed active floodplain restoration project is located at the 2.4-acre, town-owned parcel at the end of River Road West, Johnson, VT. This property, VT Route 15, and the Village of Johnson are highly susceptible to flooding. This river/road conflict area is a key location identified for floodplain restoration in the 2019 Lamoille River Flood Model. The floodplain restoration project will enhance floodplain access by removing a man-made berm, lower the floodplain, and create a riparian forest. The project will allow floodwaters to dissipate naturally into a vegetated area, improve “hydraulic roughness,” and prevent the spread of invasive species. Increasing access to the floodplain will reduce future flooding and erosion along Route 15, in the Village of Johnson, and along the banks of the Lamoille River. This project expands upon previous hydraulic modeling efforts along the Lamoille River. The 2019 Lamoille River Flood Model identified where active floodplain restoration has the potential to reduce flood levels and flood water velocities in the Village of Johnson and on Route 15. Due to the Holmes Meadows’ critical location at a bend in the Lamoille Mainstem near the confluence with the Gihon River, floodplain restoration would reduce potential risks and damages from flooding and ice jamming by providing a location for the river to deposit ice and other debris outside of the river channel. This project will aid in reducing the flow of nutrients and sediment from flood waters to the Lamoille River by improving floodplain function and management, allowing floodwaters to access the floodplain and sediment to drop out onto the field during flooding events. The hydraulic modeling for the proposed active floodplain restoration demonstrates an existing berm blocks flood flows from reaching the floodplain until flood waters are higher than the 50-year flood. In addition to floodplain restoration and berm removal, the final design and engineering work will incorporate a vision for the site identified during community engagement meetings.",

    "bid_description": "The Northeastern Vermont Development Association (NVDA), the regional planning and development corporation serving the Northeast Kingdom, is seeking design and engineering assistance on behalf of the Town of Hardwick. The Town is planning a new municipal infrastructure campus on Creamery Road that will co-locate a new Town Garage and Hardwick Fire Department. Hardwick Rescue a private, nonprofit ambulance service that responds to 911 calls in Hardwick, Wolcott, Stannard, Craftsbury, Greensboro, Wheelock, Walden, and Woodbury, also intends to lease space on the same site to build a new facility. The Town of Hardwick has developed conceptual plans for the new Town Garage, which will replace the existing undersized facility. However, the existing conceptual designs for the Town Garage do not account for co-location with the Hardwick Fire Station or Hardwick Rescue. The existing Fire Station, located on Wolcott Street has experienced repetitive flooding. The most recent flooding occurred in July 2023, and the fire trucks had to be moved. Relocation of this critical infrastructure will help to make the community more flood resilient. Hardwick Rescue’s plan for a new facility may include an expanded footprint, and without additional architectural investigation, it is not clear how all three functions can be effectively located on the site. An architectural/engineering firm would therefore be needed to fully vet the co-location concept. The proposed location on Creamery Road also currently contains a WWII-era Quonset garage, which may require an assessment by a licensed architectural historian to determine what mitigation strategies might be required.",

    "bid_description": "Date of Issue: February 12, 2025 Closing Date: March 6, 2025, 3:00 p.m. The Town of Stratton, in Windham County, Vermont, is seeking the services of a qualified consultant to create a new Local Hazard Mitigation Plan for the Town of 440. The plan will be submitted to FEMA for approval. The selected consultant(s) shall 1) demonstrate the ability to identify various hazard mitigation strategies that will eliminate or greatly reduce the impact of hazards that may affect the municipality and 2) have experience related to mitigation planning work. Funding Source: This work is funded by a Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant from FEMA. The selected consultant must be available and willing to complete the required work within 18 months of the date of the award of this contract, including FEMA approval. It is anticipated that the FEMA grant funds will cover all of the consultant expense, which will account for 90% of the entire project cost. The Town of Stratton will be responsible for the remaining 10% of project cost, through a combination cash and in-kind hours. Tasks that will be undertaken by the Town of Stratton staff and officials include: • General printing, photocopying, and other direct meeting expenses such as public notices. • Public outreach and publicity efforts. • Research (e.g. listers’ data, flood levels and loss data). The consultant will assist the Town of Stratton in tracking and helping to maximize in-kind hours towards the required match. The amount available for consultant expense is capped at $13,150.00. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency will be given very serious consideration. The selected consultant will be expected to propose a budget and timeline that makes the most cost-effective and expedient use of all in-kind resources, as well as other cost-saving measures, such as teleconferencing. Project Proposal The project proposal should be organized along the following steps (some discretion is allowed as long as the proposal is in line with the requirements of the FEMA Review Tool effective in 2023). Each step should indicate the consultant’s role and responsibility, proposed date for completion, number of consultant hours required for each step, hourly rates and any associated direct expense. The Town of Stratton brings to this project a willingness to align its resources in the most cost-effective manner possible, so consultants are strongly encouraged to suggest strategies for delegating responsibilities. Step Description 1. Assemble planning team and meet with consultant(s) to review the planning process and confirm outreach strategy. 2. Establish work plan with deliverables, timelines for completion and confirmed roles and responsibilities. 3. Review information on hazard history and future conditions utilizing best available data to determine priorities based on risk. 4. Design and initiate a public participation strategy for the jurisdiction to maximize meaningful public participation from stakeholder groups identified in the FEMA Local Mitigation Planning Policy Guidance. Request for public input is to occur during drafting stages of the plan, and when a draft is available, and may include outreach to local newspapers, surveys, meetings open to the public, posted fliers, or other alternatives. 5. Complete hazard assessment to determine vulnerability to each hazard and quantify the extent of each hazard. 6. Identify mitigation strategies to address vulnerabilities to each hazard. 7. Draft and submit plan to Vermont Emergency Management (VEM) and revise accordingly. 8. Submit revised plan to VEM, revise if necessary. 9. Adopt plan and return the final plan to VEM and FEMA. The final plan document developed by the consultant will be available to the Town of ¬¬¬¬¬Stratton in an accessible format (e.g. Word) to be used in future plan updates. This plan is funded through a FEMA planning grant under BRIC 2022. The Period of Performance (POP) for the grant funding this work is through 11/21/2026 and no expenses related to this project can be charged beyond this date. VEM requires LHMPs are complete and approved three months prior to the POP date to allow for reimbursement and grant management with FEMA.

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (“RFP”) The Town of Tunbridge (“The Town”) is accepting proposals (“Proposals”) from engineering, procurement and construction companies (“EPC Companies”) for turnkey construction of a 10.7 kW (AC) solar array expansion (the “Project”). The new construction will be an addition to an existing 3 kW (AC) solar energy system and will group net meter to two municipal buildings in town. The group net metering Certificate of Public Good was finalized last year. 1. Location – At the location of the existing 3 kW facility at the field adjacent to Town garage located at 64 Recreation Rd, Tunbridge, VT 05077. 2. Site Visit – EPC Companies are encouraged to visit the site on Thursday February 27 at 9:00 AM or, if it cannot make that date, by contacting Kirt Mayland at kmayland@vermontlaw.edu for an alternative date. The expected location will be next to the location of the current 3 kW system although the final exact location will be determined by the Town. As this is a Project expansion, among other things, a site visit will allow the interested EPC Companies to see the existing 3 kW system and associated equipment and infrastructure. 3. Proposals and pricing shall be for a turnkey project - all work necessary to get the Project commissioned with Green Mountain Power and commercial operation, as determined by the Town. Site work and all interconnection work, line extensions, studies etc. must be included in the pricing. In addition, the Town would like to be able to remotely monitor the Project so remote monitoring technology should be included in the pricing. The Project will be owned and operated by the Town and the Town will most likely want to contract with the EPC Company selected for operation and maintenance services if available. 4. Along with the turnkey price to be included in the Proposal Sheet at the end of this RFP, Proposals should also include: a. An estimated site plan including DC size b. A breakdown of costs, including a list of all equipment, materials, supplies, management, and labor necessary to install and interconnect the Project including, but not limited to, racking, PV solar panels, inverters, transformers, metering equipment, remote monitoring technology and other required equipment as necessary to provide a turnkey solar array expansion connected to the Green Mountain Power distribution grid.

EPC Companies should, at their discretion, include the work and any other work they may see as required as additional options to and beyond the work outlined herein at EPC Companies’ option. Work is expected to be completed no later than the end of August 2025. No mobilization charges will be permitted. 5. The EPC Company should provide references in the Proposal Sheet to this RFP. The Town may also request that an EPC Company demonstrate that it owns or has access to the equipment required to perform this work and the capital or funds to carry out the Project. 6. The EPC Company selected by the Town will work under the direction of the Town of Tunbridge. 7. Funding for the Project comes from a state grant. In accordance with the grant, invoicing shall be for work satisfactorily completed as determined by the Town to be paid as one lump sum after commercial operation or as negotiated with the Town. The EPC Company selected by the Town will promptly submit bills to the Town within one month of the expenses incurred due to state grant reimbursement deadlines, or risk non-payment. 8. Attempts to alter the terms of a proposal or negotiate with the Town in bad faith or to not pursue the Project in a diligent and timely manner following an award shall subject the EPC Company selected by the Town to termination at the Town’s discretion. 9. Nothing in this RFP or any of the responses shall be considered confidential. 10. Interpretation of the wording of this RFP shall be the sole right and responsibility of the Town, and that interpretation shall be final. 11. By responding to this RFP, an EPC company hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless the Town and its affiliates, consultants, lawyers, employees, agents and subcontractors from and against all losses from claims, demands, payments, suits, actions, recoveries and judgments of every nature and description brought or recovered against the Town by reason of any omission or act of the EPC Company, its agents, employees, subcontractors in connection with this RFP or ensuing work.
