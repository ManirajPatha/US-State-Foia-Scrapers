        "Description": "The North Carolina Home Inspector Licensure Board (NCHILB or Board) is responsible for creating a Board-developed Continuing Education (CE) Update Course annually for licensees on active status. The North Carolina Department of Insurance (NCDOI), Office of State Fire Marshal, Engineering Division provides staff to this Board. The update course provides four (4) hours of the total twelve (12) hour annual CE currently required to renew a license by September 30th. The other eight (8) hours are provided through elective courses developed by Board-approved Education Sponsors. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7143-151.49(a)(12) and \u00a7143-151.64 provide legislative authority. N.C. Administrative Code 11 NCAC 08 Section .1300 provides specific information on CE requirements including the Update Course. 11 NCAC 08.1309 Update Course Component, subparagraph (b) states in part \u201cThe subject matter of this course shall be determined by the Board, which shall prepare a completely new course for each one-year period beginning October 1 and ending September 30. Sponsors shall acquire the Board-developed course materials and utilize such materials to conduct the update course. The course shall be conducted exactly as prescribed by the rules in this Section and the course materials developed by the Board. Sponsors shall provide licensees participating in their classes a copy of the student materials developed by the Board.\u201d\nThe Board By-Laws provide for several standing committees, one of which is the Education Committee. The Education Committee is responsible for administering the CE program, including determining the mandatory and update courses required each year and for administering the Pre-licensing education program, including determining the scope and extent of required courses. For the license renewal period / CE year October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026, the Education Committee has recommended, and the Board has approved, an Update Course entitled \u201cThe Purpose and Scope of the Direction Statement.\u201d\nSince its creation in 1996, the Board has developed some update courses in-house using committee members and staff. Multiple vendors may have an interest in developing such a course. Typically, the concept of the course and learning outcomes to be achieved are discussed with the vendor in one or more committee scoping sessions in the first quarter of the calendar year using prior courses as a reference. The vendor then prepares an outline and/or draft of the course and submits the same to the Education Committee for review and approval prior to the April meeting of the Board. The final submission to the committee is then recommended for approval by the Board no later than the July meeting of the Board. Once the Update Course receives final Board approval, the vendor schedules a workshop for all Board-approved Update Course Sponsors and Instructors interested in teaching the Update Course. The vendor provides all workshop attendees the course Sponsor, Instructor and Student materials and teaches the course so that the course \u201cshall be conducted exactly as prescribed\u2026\u201d Update Course Sponsors and Instructors are responsible for making copies of all materials for their students. 11 NCAC 08.1312 requires the student fee paid for the Update Course to be all-inclusive, and no separate or additional fee may be charged to students for providing course materials required by the Board, providing course completion certificates, reporting course completion to the Board, or for recouping similar routine administrative expenses. The total amount of any fees to be charged shall be included in any advertising or promotional materials for the course.\nAdditional information is available through the Board web site <span style=\"mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri;mso-asci",

        "Description": "Citizen Review Panels (CRPs) were developed in response to a requirement set forth in the 1996 reauthorization for the Child Abuse and Prevention Treatment Act (CAPTA), section 106 (c). The CRPs are directed to evaluate state child welfare agencies and make recommendations for improvement in child protective services. In doing so, they are to assess how well the state is coordinating adoption and foster care programs and how child fatalities are reviewed. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS), Division of Social Services (NC DSS) is the state\u2019s child welfare authority responsible for the oversight of CRPs in North Carolina. Currently, to meet federal requirements, NC DSS has designated the state\u2019s existing 101 Community Child Protection Teams (CCPTs) as CRPs. CCPTs are interdisciplinary groups of community representatives that were established in 1991 under N.C. General Statute \u00a7 7B-1406, and further formalized and expanded in 1993, to promote a community-wide approach to the problem of child abuse and neglect.  Legislation passed in 2024 requires North Carolina to establish a minimum of 3 CRPs by January 2025 in compliance with the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).",

Strategic plans help managers develop a detailed course of action. The Board currently has a significant fund balance due to the strong housing market of the past several years. Tens of thousands of home inspections are performed on existing homes each year. The number of home inspections performed on new construction homes is significant. \nA two (2) day session is anticipated in association with a regular quarterly meeting of the Board October 9 and 10, 2024, with public notice and opportunity for public comment. \nThe Board consists of eight (8) members appointed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 143-151.46. The Engineering Division provides clerical and other staff services required by the Board pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 143-151.63.

Also, to include the enhancement of the dining experience, to support the student\u2019s well-being, academic success, and overall satisfaction with campus life.

The events that require the most staffing are Men\u2019s Basketball and Football.  Currently we utilize assistance from the law enforcement agencies with UNC Hospitals, Orange County, the Town of Chapel Hill and Carrboro.  The university reimburses those entities at the time and a half rate of those officers plus fringe benefits.  UNC PD would like to contract with a company that can procure officers whose agencies through agreement with UNC have allowed those officers to work special events.      All officers, absent UNC PD Officers, would be compensated at a standard rate.  The service requirements we are looking for are as follows:\n\n\u2022\tVendor has web-based mechanism which allows UNC PD to post assignments and allows eligible officers to sign up electronically\n\u2022\tVendor has ability to directly pay individual officers \n\u2022\tVendor has ability to calculate total cost for each event, including pre-determined administrative fees and bill UNC\n\u2022\tVendor has 24/7 customer service capabilities\n\u2022\tVendor provides supplemental insurance that covers general and professional liability\n\u2022\tVendor maintains scheduling and event history that can be accessed electronically\n\nThis change in procurement will enable UNC to have more adequate staffing for university events and will also allow departments to better predict and budget for costs associated with these events.  \n",

Feeders for the replaced panelboards shall be replaced.  Additional associated work required to clean up the Main Electrical Room, along with removing an existing water heater and installing, and connecting a new water heater (furnished by the Owner) will be required.  Due the possible long delivery time for the switchboard, the work will need to be phased, with as much work that can be done prior to the installation of the new switchboard as possible.  The installation of the switchboard will require the Duke Energy transformer to be de-energized, and the shutdown of the building.  This work will need to be scheduled in advance with the Owner and may have to be done on holidays and weekends.\n\n",
